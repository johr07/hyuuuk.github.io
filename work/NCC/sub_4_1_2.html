                                    Objective: We explored the relationship between adherence to self-reporting and
                                    weight loss outcomes during the time series weight reduction process with the
                                    following 3 research questions: “How does adherence to self-reporting of body weight
                                    and meal history change over time?”, “How do weight loss outcomes depend on weight
                                    changes over time?”, and “How does adherence to the weight loss intervention change
                                    over time by gender?”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Methods: We analyzed self-reported data collected weekly for 16 weeks (January 2017
                                    to March 2018) from 684 Korean men and women who participated in a mobile weight
                                    loss intervention program provided by a mobile diet app called Noom. Analysis of
                                    variance (ANOVA) and chi-squared tests were employed to determine whether the
                                    baseline characteristics among the groups of weight loss results were different.
                                    Based on the ANOVA results and slope analysis of the trend indicating participant
                                    behavior along the time axis, we explored the relationship between adherence to
                                    self-reporting and weight loss results.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Results: Adherence to self-reporting levels decreased over time, as previous studies
                                    have found. BMI change patterns (ie, absolute BMI values and change in BMI values
                                    within a week) changed over time and were characterized in 3 time series periods.
                                    The relationships between the weight loss outcome and both meal history and
                                    self-reporting patterns were gender-dependent. There was no statistical association
                                    between adherence to self-reporting and weight loss outcomes in the male
                                    participants.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Conclusions: Although mobile technology has increased the convenience of
                                    selfreporting when dieting, it should be noted that technology itself is not the
                                    essence of weight loss. The in-depth understanding of the relationship between
                                    adherence to selfreporting and weight loss outcome found in this study may
                                    contribute to the development of better weight loss interventions in mobile
                                    environments.

                                    Methods: We analyzed self-reported data collected weekly for 16 weeks (January 2017
                                    to March 2018) from 684 Korean men and women who participated in a mobile weight
                                    loss intervention program provided by a mobile diet app called Noom. Analysis of

                                    baseline characteristics among the groups of weight loss results were different.

                                    behavior along the time axis, we explored the relationship between adherence to

                                    Methods: We analyzed self-reported data collected weekly for 16 weeks (January 2017
                                    to March 2018) from 684 Korean men and women who participated in a mobile weight
                                    loss intervention program provided by a mobile diet app called Noom. Analysis of
                                    variance (ANOVA) and chi-squared tests were employed to determine whether the
                                    baseline characteristics among the groups of weight loss results were different.
                                    Based on the ANOVA results and slope analysis of the trend indicating participant
                                    behavior along the time axis, we explored the relationship between adherence to
                                    self-reporting and weight loss results.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Results: Adherence to self-reporting levels decreased over time, as previous studies
                                    have found. BMI change patterns (ie, absolute BMI values and change in BMI values
                                    within a week) changed over time and were characterized in 3 time series periods.
                                    The relationships between the weight loss outcome and both meal history and
                                    self-reporting patterns were gender-dependent. There was no statistical association
                                    between adherence to self-reporting and weight loss outcomes in the male
                                    participants.<br>

                                    Conclusions: Although mobile technology has increased the convenience of
                                    selfreporting when dieting, it should be noted that technology itself is not the

                                    Background: Mobile apps for weight loss provide users with convenient features for
                                    recording lifestyle and health indicators; they have been widely used for weight
                                    loss recently. Previous studies in this field generally focused on the relationship
                                    between the cumulative nature of self-reported data and the results in weight loss
                                    at the end of the diet period. Therefore, we conducted an in-depth study to explore
                                    the relationships between adherence to self-reporting and weight loss outcomes
                                    during the weight reduction process.<br>

                                    Objective: We explored the relationship between adherence to self-reporting and
                                    weight loss outcomes during the time series weight reduction process with the
                                    following 3 research questions: “How does adherence to self-reporting of body weight
                                    and meal history change over time?”, “How do weight loss outcomes depend on weight
                                    changes over time?”, and “How does adherence to the weight loss intervention change

                                    <br>
                                    Methods: We analyzed self-reported data collected weekly for 16 weeks (January 2017
                                    to March 2018) from 684 Korean men and women who participated in a mobile weight
                                    loss intervention program provided by a mobile diet app called Noom. Analysis of

                                    baseline characteristics among the groups of weight loss results were different.
                                    Based on the ANOVA results and slope analysis of the trend indicating participant
                                    behavior along the time axis, we explored the relationship between adherence to

                                    The relationships between the weight loss outcome and both meal history and
                                    self-reporting patterns were gender-dependent. There was no statistical association
